# AI Integration

## Overview
The trading bot will leverage AI to analyze news sentiment and economic events, providing additional context for trading signals. This integration aims to enhance decision-making by adjusting confidence levels, filtering signals, or avoiding trades during high-impact news events.

## Workflow

### 1. News Data Collection
- **Sources**:  
  - Utilize `NewsAPI` to fetch news articles and headlines.  
  - Prioritize sources such as Bloomberg, Reuters, and CNBC.  
- **Filters**:  
  - Track news related to specific trading pairs (e.g., EURUSD, GBPUSD).  
  - Monitor economic calendars for high-impact events (e.g., interest rate decisions, employment reports).  

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- **Model**:  
  - Employ OpenAI’s GPT for advanced sentiment analysis.  
  - Alternatively, use VADER for simpler sentiment scoring.  
- **Output**:  
  - Assign a sentiment score (e.g., -1 for bearish, 0 for neutral, +1 for bullish).  
  - Example: "Fed raises interest rates" → Bearish sentiment for EURUSD.  

### 3. Event Impact Analysis
- **High-Impact Events**:  
  - Identify events likely to cause significant market volatility (e.g., FOMC meetings, NFP reports).  
  - Example: Avoid trading during the 30 minutes before and after a high-impact event.  

### 4. Signal Adjustment
- **Confidence Level Adjustment**:  
  - Increase confidence for signals aligned with positive sentiment.  
  - Decrease confidence for signals conflicting with negative sentiment.  
- **Signal Filtering**:  
  - Filter out signals during high-impact news events.  
  - Example: Ignore Buy signals during bearish news for EURUSD.

## Implementation

### 1. News API Integration
- Utilize `NewsAPI` to fetch news data.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  import requests

  API_KEY = 'your_newsapi_key'
  url = f'https://newsapi.org/v2/everything?q=EURUSD&apiKey={API_KEY}'
  response = requests.get(url)
  news_data = response.json()
  ```

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Use OpenAI’s GPT for advanced analysis.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  from openai import ChatCompletion

  def analyze_sentiment(text):
      response = ChatCompletion.create(
          model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
          messages=[{"role": "user", "content": f"Analyze sentiment for: {text}"}]
      )
      return response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
  ```

### 3. Event Impact Detection
- Use an economic calendar API (e.g., Alpha Vantage or FXCM Economic Calendar).  
- Example:  
  ```python
  def is_high_impact_event(event):
      high_impact_events = ['FOMC', 'NFP', 'CPI']
      return any(keyword in event for keyword in high_impact_events)
  ```

### 4. Signal Adjustment Logic
- Adjust confidence levels based on sentiment.  
- Example:  
  ```python
  def adjust_confidence(signal, sentiment_score):
      if sentiment_score > 0:
          signal['confidence'] *= 1.2  # Increase confidence for bullish sentiment
      elif sentiment_score < 0:
          signal['confidence'] *= 0.8  # Decrease confidence for bearish sentiment
      return signal
  ```

## Example Workflow

1. **News Fetching**:  
   - Bot fetches news articles related to EURUSD.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:  
   - Analyzes headlines like "Fed raises interest rates" and assigns a bearish sentiment score.

3. **Event Impact Detection**:  
   - Identifies an upcoming FOMC meeting as a high-impact event.

4. **Signal Adjustment**:  
   - Adjusts confidence levels for Buy signals during bearish sentiment.
   - Filters out signals during the FOMC meeting.
