# Risk Management

## Overview
The trading bot will implement dynamic risk management strategies to optimize position sizing, stop-loss, and take-profit levels. All trade details will be logged and saved to an Excel sheet for record-keeping and analysis.

## Position Sizing

### 1. Dynamic Position Sizing
- **Formula**:  
  Position size = (Account Balance × Risk Percentage) / (Stop-Loss Distance × Pip Value)  
  - **Account Balance**: Current balance of the trading account.  
  - **Risk Percentage**: User-defined risk per trade (e.g., 1-2%).  
  - **Stop-Loss Distance**: Distance between entry price and stop-loss in pips.  
  - **Pip Value**: Value of one pip for the trading pair.  

- **Example**:  
  - Account Balance: $10,000  
  - Risk Percentage: 1%  
  - Stop-Loss Distance: 50 pips  
  - Pip Value: $10 (for EURUSD)  
  - Position Size = ($10,000 × 0.01) / (50 × $10) = 0.2 lots  

### 2. User-Defined Risk Tolerance
- Allow users to set their risk percentage via Telegram or configuration file.  
- Default to 1% risk per trade if not specified.

## Stop-Loss and Take-Profit

### 1. Dynamic Stop-Loss
- **Placement**:  
  - Based on market structure (e.g., below support for Buy signals, above resistance for Sell signals).  
  - Adjusted for volatility (e.g., wider stop-loss during high volatility).  

- **Example**:  
  - Buy Signal: Stop-loss placed 10 pips below the nearest support level.  
  - Sell Signal: Stop-loss placed 10 pips above the nearest resistance level.  

### 2. Dynamic Take-Profit
- **Placement**:  
  - Based on risk-reward ratio (e.g., 1:2 or user-defined).  
  - Adjusted for key levels (e.g., take-profit at the next resistance level for Buy signals).  

- **Example**:  
  - Buy Signal: Take-profit placed at 1:2 risk-reward ratio (e.g., 100 pips above entry if stop-loss is 50 pips).

## Trade Journaling

### 1. Logged Details
- **Trade ID**: Unique identifier for each trade.  
- **Time and Date**: Timestamp of trade execution.  
- **Trading Pair**: Currency pair or instrument traded.  
- **Signal Type**: Buy, Sell, or Hold.  
- **Entry Price**: Price at which the trade was executed.  
- **Stop-Loss**: Stop-loss level.  
- **Take-Profit**: Take-profit level.  
- **Position Size**: Size of the position in lots.  
- **PnL**: Profit or loss of the trade.  
- **Confidence Level**: Confidence level of the signal.  
- **Risk-Reward Ratio**: Risk-reward ratio of the trade.  

### 2. Excel Sheet Format
- **File Name**: `trade_journal.xlsx`  
- **Columns**:  
  | Trade ID | Time and Date | Trading Pair | Signal Type | Entry Price | Stop-Loss | Take-Profit | Position Size | PnL | Confidence Level | Risk-Reward Ratio |  
  |----------|---------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|-----|------------------|-------------------|  

### 3. Implementation
- Use the `openpyxl` library to create and update the Excel sheet.  
- Append new trades to the sheet after each execution.  
- Ensure the file is saved and backed up regularly.

## Example Workflow

1. **Trade Execution**:  
   - Bot detects a Buy signal for EURUSD.  
   - Calculates position size based on account balance and risk tolerance.  
   - Places stop-loss and take-profit levels dynamically.  

2. **Trade Logging**:  
   - Logs trade details to `trade_journal.xlsx`.  
   - Example Entry:  
     | Trade ID | Time and Date       | Trading Pair | Signal Type | Entry Price | Stop-Loss | Take-Profit | Position Size | PnL  | Confidence Level | Risk-Reward Ratio |
     |----------|---------------------|--------------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------|---------------|------|------------------|-------------------|
     | 1        | 2023-10-15 10:30:00 | EURUSD       | Buy         | 1.1200      | 1.1150    | 1.1300      | 0.2           | +100 | 80%              | 1:2               |

3. **Trade Monitoring**:  
   - Bot monitors the trade and adjusts stop-loss/take-profit if necessary.  
   - Logs exit details once the trade is closed.

## Technologies and Libraries
- **Position Sizing**: Custom logic.  
- **Stop-Loss/Take-Profit**: Custom logic based on market structure.  
- **Trade Journaling**: `openpyxl` library for Excel sheet management.  
- **Logging**: `Loguru` for tracking risk management activities.

# Risk Management Rules

The Risk Management Rules define the guidelines for trade entries and position management. They help ensure that the trading bot operates within predefined risk limits and follows a structured approach to managing trades.

## Entry Conditions
The Entry Conditions specify the criteria that must be met before entering a trade. These conditions help filter out low-quality setups and ensure that the bot only enters trades with a favorable risk-reward ratio. The Entry Conditions include:

1. **Minimum Confirmation Requirements**: Defines the minimum number of Confirmation Signals that a trade setup must have before being considered for entry.

2. **Timeframe Confluence**: Requires that the trade setup is confirmed across multiple timeframes to ensure alignment with the overall market structure.

3. **Session-Specific Rules**: Applies session-specific entry rules based on the characteristics and volatility of the Asian, London, and New York sessions.

4. **Risk-Reward Thresholds**: Sets minimum risk-reward ratios for trade entries to ensure that the potential reward justifies the risk taken.

## Position Management
Once a trade is entered, the Position Management rules define how the trade will be managed throughout its lifecycle. These rules help optimize profitability, limit losses, and adapt to changing market conditions. The Position Management rules include:

1. **Dynamic Stop Loss Placement**: Adjusts the stop loss levels based on market volatility and the trade's progress. This helps protect profits and limit losses in case of adverse market movements.

2. **Take Profit Levels Based on Structure**: Sets take profit levels based on key structural levels, such as swing highs/lows or support/resistance zones, to maximize potential profits.

3. **Position Sizing Rules**: Defines the rules for determining the size of each trade based on the account balance, risk per trade, and market conditions. This helps ensure consistent risk management across all trades.

4. **Maximum Risk per Trade**: Sets a maximum risk limit per trade to prevent excessive losses and protect the overall account balance.

By adhering to these Risk Management Rules, the trading bot can make informed decisions about trade entries and manage positions effectively. The specific parameters, such as risk-reward ratios, stop loss levels, and position sizing, can be customized based on the trading strategy and risk tolerance.

It's important to regularly review and adjust the Risk Management Rules based on the bot's performance and changing market conditions. This iterative process helps optimize the bot's profitability and risk management over time.
