# Signal Generation Logic

## Overview
The trading bot uses a sophisticated multi-component analysis system to generate trading signals. Each component contributes to the final signal through a weighted scoring system.

## Market Structure Analysis

### 1. Swing Point Detection
- Uses a dynamic window-based approach to identify swing highs and lows
- Window size of 5 candles by default
- Compares each point with surrounding price action
```python
# Example swing high detection
if price[i] == max(price[i-window:i+window+1]):
    # Found swing high
```

### 2. Structure Breaks
- Analyzes breaks of market structure (BOS)
- Calculates break strength based on price differentials
- Types:
  - Bullish: Higher highs and higher lows
  - Bearish: Lower highs and lower lows
```python
# Break strength calculation
strength = (new_high - previous_high) / previous_high
```

### 3. Order Block Identification
- Identifies institutional order blocks after structure breaks
- Characteristics:
  - Bullish OB: Bearish candle before bullish break
  - Bearish OB: Bullish candle before bearish break
- Includes strength metrics based on break magnitude

### 4. Fair Value Gaps (FVG)
- Detects price inefficiencies in market structure
- Types:
  - Bullish FVG: When low[i+1] > high[i-1]
  - Bearish FVG: When high[i+1] < low[i-1]
- Tracks gap size and timestamp for reference

### 5. Liquidity Analysis
- Identifies liquidity voids based on volume and price range
- Threshold: 30% of average volume
- Considers price range relative to structure break threshold

### 6. Market Bias Determination
Multiple factors considered:
1. Recent structure breaks (last 3)
2. Swing point progression
3. Moving average alignment (EMA20, EMA50)
4. Combined for final bias:
   - Bullish: Higher breaks + Higher highs + Price > EMAs
   - Bearish: Lower breaks + Lower lows + Price < EMAs
   - Neutral: Mixed conditions

## Signal Generation Process

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gathers data for all timeframes
   - Calculates technical indicators
   - Retrieves sentiment data if available

2. **Component Analysis**
   Each component generates a score between -1 and 1:
   - Negative scores indicate bearish bias
   - Positive scores indicate bullish bias
   - Zero indicates neutral

3. **Signal Scoring**
   Final score calculation:
   ```python
   final_score = (
       trend_score * 0.15 +
       structure_score * 0.20 +
       smc_score * 0.20 +
       mtf_score * 0.15 +
       divergence_score * 0.15 +
       volume_score * 0.15
   )
   ```

4. **Signal Classification**
   - Strong signals (>0.7): 95% confidence
   - Moderate signals (>0.5): 75% confidence
   - Weak signals (>0.3): 50% confidence
   - Below 0.3: HOLD signal

## Trade Parameters

The system also calculates:
- Entry price
- Stop loss levels (based on structure)
- Take profit levels (based on structure)
- Position size (based on risk parameters)

## Risk Filters

Before executing trades:
1. Session-specific checks
2. Volatility requirements
3. Spread checks
4. Risk management rules
5. Daily risk limits

## Implementation Notes

- All thresholds are configurable
- System uses pip-based measurements
- Error handling at each step
- Comprehensive logging
- Real-time dashboard updates

## Primary Filters
The Primary Filters are the initial checks that a potential trade setup must pass before being considered for further analysis. The filters include:

1. **Timeframe Alignment Check**: Ensures that the trade setup aligns with the higher timeframe trends and structures.

2. **Session-Specific Conditions**: Applies session-specific rules based on the characteristics of the Asian, London, and New York sessions.

3. **Standard Deviation Thresholds**: Checks if the price is within the defined standard deviation bands for the relevant timeframes.

4. **Market Structure Status**: Verifies if the current market structure supports the potential trade setup, considering factors such as swing highs/lows and structure breaks.

## Confirmation Signals
Once a potential trade setup passes the Primary Filters, it is subjected to further analysis using Confirmation Signals. These signals provide additional validation and help filter out low-quality setups. The Confirmation Signals include:

1. **SMT Divergence Validation**: Checks for divergences between price and the Smart Money Tracker (SMT) indicator to confirm the strength of the setup.

2. **Liquidity Sweep Detection**: Identifies potential liquidity sweeps, which can indicate a strong move in the market.

3. **Momentum Analysis**: Analyzes the momentum of the price movement using indicators such as Moving Averages or Stochastic Oscillator.

4. **Pattern Recognition**: Looks for specific price action patterns, such as Order Blocks or FVGs, that align with the potential trade setup.

The Signal Generation Logic combines the results of the Primary Filters and Confirmation Signals to determine the final trade signal. If a setup passes all the filters and receives sufficient confirmation, it is considered a valid trade signal and is passed on to the Risk Management module for further processing.

The specific implementation details of each filter and signal, such as the thresholds, indicators, and patterns used, can be customized based on the trading strategy and market conditions.

By breaking down the Signal Generation Logic into Primary Filters and Confirmation Signals, the trading bot can efficiently analyze potential trade setups and generate high-quality signals while minimizing false positives.

## Overview
The trading bot will generate **Buy**, **Sell**, and **Hold** signals based on a combination of technical indicators, market structure analysis, and session-specific conditions. Each signal will include additional details like confidence levels and risk-reward ratios to assist users in making informed decisions.
