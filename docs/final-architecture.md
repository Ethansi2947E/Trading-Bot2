# Final Architecture

## Overview
The trading bot is a Python-based system that integrates with MetaTrader 5 (MT5) for data collection and trade execution, Telegram for user interaction and alerts, and AI for news sentiment analysis. It is designed to run on a local Windows machine and includes modules for signal generation, risk management, and performance monitoring.

## High-Level Architecture

### 1. **Data Collection Module**
- **Purpose**: Fetch real-time market data from MT5 and store it for analysis.  
- **Components**:  
  - **MT5 Integration**: Use the `MetaTrader5` library to connect to MT5 and collect price data.  
  - **Data Storage**: Store historical data and calculated metrics in an SQLite database.  

### 2. **Signal Generation Module**
- **Purpose**: Generate Buy, Sell, and Hold signals based on technical indicators and market structure.  
- **Components**:  
  - **Technical Indicators**: Use `ta-lib` or `pandas_ta` to calculate indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD).  
  - **Market Structure Analysis**: Track swing highs/lows, detect structure breaks, and monitor trends.  
  - **Confirmation Signals**: Validate signals using SMT divergence, liquidity sweeps, and pattern recognition.  

### 3. **Risk Management Module**
- **Purpose**: Manage position sizing, stop-loss, take-profit, and trade journaling.  
- **Components**:  
  - **Dynamic Position Sizing**: Calculate position size based on account balance and risk tolerance.  
  - **Dynamic Stop-Loss/Take-Profit**: Adjust levels based on market structure and volatility.  
  - **Trade Journaling**: Log trade details (e.g., entry/exit prices, PnL) in an Excel sheet using `openpyxl`.  

### 4. **Telegram Integration Module**
- **Purpose**: Enable user interaction and send real-time alerts.  
- **Components**:  
  - **User Commands**: Allow users to start/stop the bot, view performance metrics, and check trade history.  
  - **Alerts**: Send setup, entry, management, and exit alerts via Telegram.  
  - **Authentication**: Restrict access to authorized users.  

### 5. **AI Integration Module**
- **Purpose**: Analyze news sentiment and economic events to enhance trading decisions.  
- **Components**:  
  - **News Data Collection**: Use `NewsAPI` to fetch news articles and headlines.  
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Use OpenAI’s GPT or VADER to analyze sentiment and assign scores.  
  - **Signal Adjustment**: Adjust confidence levels and filter signals based on sentiment and event impact.  

### 6. **Logging and Monitoring Module**
- **Purpose**: Track bot activities and visualize performance metrics.  
- **Components**:  
  - **Logging**: Use `Loguru` to log bot activities, errors, and performance metrics.  
  - **Monitoring Dashboard**: Use `Dash` to create a web-based dashboard for real-time insights.  
  - **Alerting**: Send critical alerts (e.g., failed trades, connection issues) via Telegram.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:  
   - Fetch real-time market data from MT5.  
   - Store historical data and calculated metrics in SQLite.  

2. **Signal Generation**:  
   - Generate Buy, Sell, and Hold signals based on technical indicators and market structure.  
   - Validate signals using confirmation rules.  

3. **Risk Management**:  
   - Calculate position size and adjust stop-loss/take-profit levels dynamically.  
   - Log trade details in an Excel sheet.  

4. **Telegram Integration**:  
   - Send real-time alerts to users.  
   - Allow users to interact with the bot via commands.  

5. **AI Integration**:  
   - Fetch and analyze news sentiment.  
   - Adjust trading signals based on sentiment and event impact.  

6. **Logging and Monitoring**:  
   - Log bot activities and errors.  
   - Visualize performance metrics on a dashboard.  
   - Send critical alerts via Telegram.

## Deployment
The bot will run on a local Windows machine. Ensure the following:
1. Install Python and all required libraries using the provided installation script.  
2. Set up MT5 and configure the `MetaTrader5` library.  
3. Create a Telegram bot using the **BotFather** and configure the `python-telegram-bot` library.  
4. Use a task scheduler (e.g., Windows Task Scheduler) to run the bot automatically at startup.
