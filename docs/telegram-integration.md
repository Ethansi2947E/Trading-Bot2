# Telegram Integration

## Overview
The Telegram bot will serve as the primary interface for users to interact with the trading bot. It will allow users to start/stop the bot, view performance metrics, and access trade history. The bot will also send real-time alerts and error notifications.

---

## Features

### 1. User Commands
- **/start**: Initialize the bot and display a welcome message with available commands.
- **/stop**: Stop the bot and cancel all active trades.
- **/status**: Check the current status of the bot (e.g., running, stopped).
- **/metrics**: View performance metrics (e.g., win rate, profit/loss, drawdown).
- **/history**: View trade history (e.g., past trades, entry/exit points, PnL).
- **/help**: Display a list of available commands and their descriptions.

### 2. Authentication
- **User Verification**: Only authorized users (based on Telegram user IDs) can interact with the bot.
- **Secure Storage**: Store user credentials securely using environment variables or a configuration file.

### 3. Alerts
- **Setup Alerts**: Notify users of potential trades forming (e.g., "EURUSD: Potential buy setup forming on H1").
- **Entry Alerts**: Notify users of confirmed signals (e.g., "EURUSD: Buy signal confirmed at 1.1200").
- **Management Alerts**: Notify users of stop-loss/take-profit adjustments (e.g., "EURUSD: Stop-loss moved to 1.1150").
- **Exit Alerts**: Notify users of trade completion (e.g., "EURUSD: Trade closed at 1.1250, +50 pips").

### 4. Error Handling
- **Failed Trades**: Notify users of failed trades (e.g., "EURUSD: Trade failed due to insufficient margin").
- **Connection Issues**: Notify users of connection issues with MT5 or other services (e.g., "MT5 connection lost, attempting to reconnect").
- **Logging**: Log all errors for debugging and analysis.

## Implementation

### 1. Telegram Bot Setup
- Use the `python-telegram-bot` library to create and manage the bot.
- Register a new bot with the **BotFather** on Telegram to get the API token.

### 2. Command Handlers
- Implement handlers for each command (`/start`, `/stop`, `/status`, `/metrics`, `/history`, `/help`).
- Use the `CommandHandler` class from `python-telegram-bot` to map commands to functions.

### 3. Authentication
- Maintain a list of authorized user IDs in a secure configuration file or environment variables.
- Verify the user ID for each incoming command.

### 4. Alerts and Notifications
- Use the `send_message` method to send alerts and notifications to users.
- Format messages clearly and include all relevant details (e.g., trading pair, signal type, prices).

### 5. Error Handling
- Use try-except blocks to catch and handle errors.
- Notify users of errors via Telegram and log them for debugging.

## Example Workflow
1. **User Initialization**:
   - User sends `/start` to initialize the bot.
   - Bot responds with a welcome message and available commands.

2. **Trade Execution**:
   - Bot detects a trade setup and sends a setup alert.
   - Bot confirms the signal and sends an entry alert.
   - Bot adjusts stop-loss/take-profit and sends management alerts.
   - Bot closes the trade and sends an exit alert.

3. **User Interaction**:
   - User sends `/metrics` to view performance metrics.
   - User sends `/history` to view trade history.
   - User sends `/stop` to stop the bot.
