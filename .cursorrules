 Rule 1: Live Trading Logic Priority
 -------------------------------------
 When making any modifications that improve live trading logic or
 the trading decision-making process, ensure that changes are applied
 only to the live trading bot's code (e.g., src/trading_bot.py) or to shared
 modules (e.g., src/common/trading_logic.py), and not to the backtesting
 files (e.g., src/backtester.py), unless explicitly specified for
 backtesting improvements.

 Rule 2: Clear Separation
 --------------------------
 - Changes affecting real-time trading operations must be isolated to the live bot.
 - Edits to backtesting code should only be made when addressing issues specific to the
   simulation, data visualization, or performance metrics in the backtesting environment.

 Rule 3: Verification Before Modification
 -------------------------------------------
 Always verify the target file before applying changes:
 - For live trading improvements: target src/trading_bot.py or shared modules.
 - For backtesting enhancements: target src/backtester.py only when explicitly required.

 Rule 4: Clarification and Confirmation
 ----------------------------------------
 In case of ambiguous requests regarding which environment to improve,
 explicitly request clarification before proceeding with file edits.

 By using these rules, inadvertent modifications to the wrong parts of the codebase
 will be minimized, ensuring consistency between live trading operations and
 backtesting results.
